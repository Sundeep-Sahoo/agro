ðŸŒ¾ Agricultural Price Prediction System A machine learningâ€“powered web application that predicts future crop prices based on weather, rainfall, and other agricultural data. The system is designed to assist farmers and stakeholders in making informed decisions to maximize productivity and profit.

âœ¨ Features Price Prediction: Estimates crop prices using historical and live weather data.

Data Integration: Pulls rainfall, temperature, and humidity data from multiple sources.

Machine Learning Model: Implements Scikit-learn and XGBoost algorithms for accurate predictions.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes real-time data trends with charts and graphs.

User-Friendly Interface: Built for easy navigation and accessibility.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy

Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (depending on deployment)

Visualization: Chart.js / Matplotlib

Deployment: Local server or cloud hosting (AWS, Render)

ðŸš€ How It Works Collects rainfall, weather, and agricultural data from public datasets.

Processes and cleans the data for machine learning.

Predicts future crop prices using trained ML models.

Displays predictions and trends via an interactive web dashboard.
